This repo stores collections I've used to pratctice and develop my Postman skills:
- "Trello API": this one is my favorite, it's where I stored arrays as variables for the first time, allowing for advanced collection chaining.
- "NASA API": this is an interesting one, most of the scripts have to do with manipulation and assertions of dates (YYYY-MM-DD).
