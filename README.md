This repo stores collections I've used to pratctice and develop my Postman skills.
- "Trello API": this one is my favorite, it's where I stored arrays as variables for the first time, allowing for some pretty advanced collection chaining.
- "NASA API": this is an interesting one, all the pre/post-request scripts have to with manipulation and assertions of dates (YYYY-MM-DD).
